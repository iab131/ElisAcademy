 * A drop-in replacement for `next/image` that gracefully handles

 * When the `src` is a Notion proxy URL (`/api/notion-image?url=...`),
 * we render it as `unoptimized` to prevent Next.js Image Optimization
 * from trying to re-fetch (and failing on) the upstream signed URL.
 * The proxy route itself handles fetching and caching.
 *
 * For all other URLs, the component delegates to `next/image` as usual.
